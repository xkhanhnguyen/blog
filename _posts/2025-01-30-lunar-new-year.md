There are days when I just want to disappear—step away from everything, sit with a cup of coffee, and lose myself in a book. But life doesn’t always allow that. Lately, work has been pulling me in every direction, leaving little space for anything else.

When I do have a free moment, I often just lie there, staring at the ceiling, letting my mind go blank, letting the bed carry the weight I no longer want to hold.

Stress builds up like dust in the corners of my mind. When it gets too much, I run. Not outside, just on the treadmill—feet hitting the belt, heartbeat loud in my ears. It doesn’t fix anything, but for a little while, it feels like I’m outrunning the noise in my head.

Lunar New Year is here, but it feels distant. No red envelopes, no bustling streets, no scent of home-cooked food filling the air. Maybe I’ve outgrown the excitement, or maybe the warmth of the holiday was never in the decorations or the traditions—it was in the people, the familiarity, the quiet understanding. And without that, it’s just another day passing.

Lately, I’ve been reading Áo Dài by Xuân Phượng. I’m halfway through. Memoirs and history always come with embellishments—memories shift, details soften, the way cooking needs a little seasoning. Maybe the author, too, had to add a little something, not to change the truth, but to bring it closer to the reader’s heart. Because sometimes, raw truth alone isn’t enough—we need it told in a way that lingers.

A few things stay with me:

- ***Your life is yours.*** No matter where you come from—wealthy parents, a brilliant partner—happiness comes from standing on your own. Financial and emotional independence are everything. I can’t control the world out there, but I can control how I respond, how I grow, how I take care of myself.
- ***Xuân Phượng was fearless.*** Born in a time when women had little control over their own lives, she defied expectations, took charge of her destiny, and built a life on her own terms.
- ***Kindness and love are the wisest ways to live.*** Money is important, but a resilient mind and a strong heart will carry me through anything.
  
There’s still half the book left, but already, it feels like a quiet kind of inspiration. A reminder that hardship doesn’t erase hope.

People say turning 30 is a milestone, but maybe it’s just another step forward—one of many. Some paths are easy, some are hard, but as long as I keep moving, I’m still on my way. Even when progress feels invisible, even when the days blur together, I have to remind myself—I can get through this. Every step counts, even the small ones. One day, I’ll look back and see—not just where I’ve been, but how far I’ve come.
