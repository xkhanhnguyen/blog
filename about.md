I started writing when I was 18, the day I left my hometown. While I looked forward to new adventures in life, I carried with me a lot of thoughts, and they stayed with me. It felt like I needed to let them out.

I held on to memories of my childhood—the thought of missing my parents, my little brother, and my best friend. The realization that our lives would no longer overlap, that I had left everything behind to move to a new city and pursue my adult life. Those memories stayed with me for a long time.

Back then, I thought writing was fun. It was a way to collect experiences and turn them into words. When I was younger and still in school, I often felt busy. Looking back now, I realize how much time I had to do so many small, joyful things.

Now, I’m over 30. Time feels different. There’s less of it for the small joys and more for things that are less fun but necessary for survival. Sometimes, I shrug and remind myself: Everything has its time. In the last three years, I haven’t written much.

The people who read my words when I was in my twenties are likely not so young anymore, either. Some might be married, others focused on their careers, and perhaps our worries no longer overlap. That’s just part of growing up, part of life.

Over the past few years, I’ve tried writing again, only to delete it later. I even pressured myself to create a website but gave up. This time, I’m trying again—and I’ll see how long I can keep it up.

I used to write for many reasons:

- To help with my career.
- To document what I learned in school.
- To share small moments with friends so they could read, laugh, and connect.  
  
Sometimes, I wrote hoping to gain attention, maybe even to become a writer. At some point, I deleted it all because I felt my blog was just a collection of complaints. I thought I wasn’t writing what people wanted to read, that I wasn’t good enough at anything.

This time, I want to do things differently:

- I’ll write for myself, in English. Processing my thoughts in English feels different than doing so in Vietnamese, and I want to explore that.
- I’ll write so I can revisit my 30s when I’m in my 40s. I’ll write about what interests me—books, education, career—sometimes even trivial things.
- I’ll keep it raw. With limited time, I’ll have to skip perfection. What I share here, from content to images, will be “rougher,” often taken straight from my notes with minimal editing.
  
I hope this space becomes a peaceful corner to write, read, and organize my thoughts—somewhere to revisit later. In my late 20s, I got lost. I was busy chasing goals, pushing myself to do more. But now, I hope to make time for the small, simple joys—those quiet moments we often forget in the rush of life.

And this is my first note.
