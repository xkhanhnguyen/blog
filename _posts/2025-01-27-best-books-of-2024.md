It’s tough to choose the best book I read last year. I finished 53 books in 2024—a mix of pure entertainment and stories that made me stop and think. Many of these were written by Asian authors, whose words stayed with me long after I closed the book. Narrowing it down wasn’t easy, but here are my list, in no particular order.

#### **Pachinko** by Min Jin Lee
Reading Pachinko felt like stepping into a family’s life and history—a story that spans generations. I read it in both Vietnamese and English, switching back and forth. Each version had its own voice, but together, they gave me a deeper understanding of the characters. It was so much more vivid than the movie adaptation. The resilience of this family—what they endured, hoped for, and sacrificed—lingered with me for days. It made me wonder: how much of our own lives are shaped by struggles we inherit?

#### **And Every Morning the Way Home Gets Longer and Longer** by Fredrik Backman
This short book hit me hard. It’s the kind of story that leaves me crying, yet I felt strangely comforted. One line that stuck with me: *“All grown-ups are angry. It’s only children and old people who laugh.”* Isn’t that true? As we grow up, we lose the lightness we once had. This story reminded me of how life shifts between holding on and letting go, and how love can feel infinite, even in the smallest moments.

#### **Algorithms to Live By** by Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths
This book is not just about computer science -- it’s about how we make choices in life. It’s a reminder that while we can’t solve everything, we can aim for better solutions. It taught me that we don’t have to solve everything perfectly. Instead, we can aim for better solutions. That shift in thinking has helped me at work and even in small decisions, like organizing my day. Prioritizing what matters, letting go of what doesn’t, and making trade-offs—it all feels like giving myself permission to breathe. It’s not about being perfect; it’s about finding peace in doing enough.

#### **Storytelling with Data** by Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic
As someone working in data, this book felt personal. It’s about making numbers tell a story, which resonates with what I do every day. Visualizing data isn’t just about charts; it’s about clarity, purpose, and impact. The lessons from this book have found their way into my job, turning reports into stories that resonate with people.

#### **The Bogleheads' Guide to Investing** by Taylor Larimore, Mel Lindauer, Michael LeBoeuf, John C. Bogle
 
This was the book that changed how I think about money. It’s simple, practical, and reassuring. The message? I don’t need to know everything about investing. I just need to stick to a few smart principles. It’s helped me see that investing doesn’t have to feel overwhelming—it can be about consistency and keeping things simple.

#### **The Devotion of Suspect X** by Keigo Higashino
Keigo Higashino is one of my favorite authors, and re-reading this book felt like catching up with an old friend. I read it in both Vietnamese and English again, for me the English translation couldn’t capture all the subtle thoughts of the Vietnamese version, however the story’s brilliance still shone through. It’s a masterful puzzle that keeps me guessing until the end.

---

#### **Human Acts** by Han Kang
This book left me speechless. I read it in parallel—Vietnamese and English—and the Vietnamese version skipped so much. The rawness of the English version made everything hit harder. Han Kang doesn’t just tell me what happened; she makes me feel it. The weight of history, the pain of humanity—it’s all there, unfiltered. I couldn’t stop thinking about it.

---

#### **Journey Under the Midnight Sun** by Keigo Higashino
This was my second read, and it’s still five stars. It’s like piecing together a puzzle—every chapter adds something new, and in the end, it all makes sense. The metaphor of people walking in sunlight while others endure darkness stayed with me. Some lives are bright, some are shadowed, and sometimes, it’s out of our control.

---

#### **Grotesque** by Natsuo Kirino
This book is dark, unsettling, and full of truths that are hard to swallow. It’s the kind of story that makes me stop and question everything: do we ever really understand anyone? Or do we just make assumptions about how they feel? Almost every character in the story is trapped in lies or delusions, and it’s a reminder of how little we know about what goes on inside someone else’s head.

#### ***The Fountainhead*** by Ayn Rand
This was a five-star read for me even before I realized Ayn Rand was a philosopher. From the moment I picked it up, the book felt like something from my grandfather’s time—something older, but timeless. Despite its age, its themes still hit close to home. Technology evolves, society becomes more equal, yet human nature? That remains unchanged? The way Rand explores this makes the book feel like a mirror held up to the world, revealing how little we’ve actually shifted over the years. What strikes me most is how relevant it feels today, showing us the truths that seem to persist through time. It’s one of those rare reads that doesn’t just tell a story—it makes me reflect on the world around, and that’s what iI love about this book.

#### **Skinny Dip** by Carl Hiaasen
I picked this up when I needed a laugh, and it delivered. It’s silly, outrageous, and ridiculously fun. I read it during a tough time, and for a while, it helped me forget everything else. Despite its lighthearted tone, the story was exciting and just the escape I needed. Sometimes, a book doesn’t need to be deep—it just needs to make me smile.

---

Each of these books gave me something—laughter, perspective, or a reason to keep turning the page. That’s why I love reading. It’s not just about finishing a book. It’s about carrying a pieces of it with me, long after the story ends.
